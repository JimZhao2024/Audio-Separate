# Music Vocal Separation Tool

This is an extremely simple tool for separating vocals and background music, completely localized for web operation,  using 2stems/4stems/5stems models.

> 
> Drag and drop a song or an audio/video file with background music into the local web page, and you can separate the vocals and music into separate audio wav files. You can choose to separate "piano sound," "bass sound," "drum sound," etc.
> 
> Automatically invoke the local browser to open the local web page, and the model is built-in, no need to connect to the external network to download.
> 
> Supports video (mp4/mov/mkv/avi/mpeg) and audio (mp3/wav) formats
> 
> Just two clicks of the mouse, one to select the audio/video file, and two to start processing.
